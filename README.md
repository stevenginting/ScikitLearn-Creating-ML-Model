# ScikitLearn-Creating-ML-Model

# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction with Random Forest

A machine learning project to predict the likelihood of heart disease using the RandomForestClassifier algorithm from scikit-learn. This project trains and evaluates a model on a medical dataset, demonstrating the basics of classification in Python.

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset used includes several medical features such as:
- Age
- Sex
- Chest Pain Type
- Resting Blood Pressure
- Cholesterol
- Max Heart Rate (thalach)
- and others

The target column is:
- `target`: `1` indicates heart disease present, `0` indicates no disease

## 📌 Features

- ✅ Preprocessing data with Pandas
- ✅ Visualization using Matplotlib
- ✅ Building and training a Random Forest model
- ✅ Comparing accuracy with different `n_estimators`
- ✅ Evaluation using `.score()` method
